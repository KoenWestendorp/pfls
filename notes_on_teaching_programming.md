Programming vs. Coding
How to do it on paper
Pretend to be Python
Stick to the point
One step further
No answers, just questions
Pep8
    - zelf goed voorbeeld
    - erop wijzen als...
They don't know what they don't know
Minimal vocabulary
Evaluations after agreement
Voorzichtig met uitspraken naar studenten toe
Programming is thinking
Algorithmic thinking
Projects agreed by coordinators
It's not about you!
    - You can share how smart you are with the other TAs!
Language
    - Alphabet
    - Syntax
    - Semantiek
Check where you are on the assessment matrix
For-loops are hard!
You can't break it!
Formulate, formalize, translate
Try to show logic
You, TA, are an abnormal/different learner
