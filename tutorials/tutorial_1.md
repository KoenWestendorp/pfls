## Data types

TA is the hands, they do the typing.
Students are the brains, they do the thinking about a problem.

What are all operations? We make a list.
Do something with all operations.


What are all data types you can think of?
How do we create each one of them?
What can we do with them? -> Example use cases.
Which ones of them are collections?
How are sets and dicts different from strings, lists, tuples.


What are all keywords you can think of?
How can we use them?


Collections

Indexing

Slicing


## A problem: palindromes

What are palindromes?
Come up with a few of them.
List them.
How could we tell a computer to figure out whether something is a palindrome or not?

Let the students come up with the required steps.
If the substeps are still too complex for Python to understand, ask them to split the problem into further subproblems.


If the group can handle it, add a string with weird stuff ("(@*#)$#@$H??//")
